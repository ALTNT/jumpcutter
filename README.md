Skips silent parts in videos, in real time.

Can be useful for watching lectures and other unedited videos.

Demo:

<!-- TODO put the file in the repo so it's set in stone? -->
<!-- The source video:

Not sure if I did comply with the license here.
But I believe this use case would be considered "fair use" anyway.

## Build

1. Install base tools:
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
    * [Yarn v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/docs/install).
2. Run

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.
    Fill the `src/_locales` directory with localization files. Skip this step if they're alredy there. Either:

    * If you're using `git`:

        `git submodule update --init`

    * If you don't want to use `git`, download them from the `translations` branch and put in `src/_locales` manually.

4.
    * To build for Gecko (e.g. Firefox):

        ```bash
        yarn build:gecko
        ```

    * To build for Chromium (e.g. Chrome)

        ```bash
        yarn build:chromium
        ```

    Bundled files will appear in `./dist`.

Then you can install it on the extensions management page of your browser ([Chromium](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked), [Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing)).

## Privacy & security

In short: it's fine.

As with practically every other extension, websites you're visiting _may_ detect that you're using this (or alike) extension, and your settings for the extension, by observing:

* playback rate changes of an element.
* the fact that `createMediaElementSource` has been called for an element.
* increased frequency of media chunk requests resulting from increased playback rate. This cannot be mitigated with disabling JavaScript.
* the fact of requesting the same media twice, as a result of using the cloning algotihm.

However I doubt that currently there are services that do specifically this. But there may be.

Other than that, there are no known things concerning this.
