  instead of `body`, but in Chromium there appears to be a bug â€“ the bottom border is not displayed.
  It appears to be related to the fact that it's truncated because the width of the border is not taken into account
  when the height of the popup is calculated - try setting `margin-top: -5px;` on html and you'll see it.
  TODO report/fix it. */
